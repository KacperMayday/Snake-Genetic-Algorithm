# Snake Genetic Algorithm
## About project
Main goal of this project is to show simple version of genetic algorithm used with neural networks. 

## How to run
1. Make sure that you acquired all needed modules (check requirements.txt).
2. Check config.py and adjust constants for your need (show or training mode). By default constants are ready for training. See configurations below for further explanation.
3. Run preparation.py and confirm.
4. Run main.py.
5. When training is ready, adjust config.py for show mode.
6. Run main.py and see the results :)
7. Play with the constants and see different outcomes after training.

## Configurations
### For training:

### For display:
